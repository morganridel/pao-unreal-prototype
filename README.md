# PAO Unreal : Game Prototype

This is a personal project supervised by a teacher who gives me feedback and advises on my work. My aim is to discover the very basics of creating a video game by first learning basic C++ and then starting to discover the Unreal Engine 4 capabilities (API, blueprints, behavior trees...)
